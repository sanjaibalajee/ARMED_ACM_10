# ArMed
### An AR Learning Platform

## Problem Statement:

The concept of our proposed solution is to integrate augmented reality (AR) technology into first aid training, providing an engaging and memorable way to learn life-saving skills. The traditional methods of learning first aid, such as textbooks or in-person courses, can be tedious and challenging to retain information. With the help of AR technology, people can visualize medical events and engage with them in a more immersive way.
ArMed, our first aid training app, allows trainees to practice performing CPR on a virtual patient with realistic visual and haptic feedback, guidance, and progress tracking. It will be a valuable educational tool for healthcare professionals/trainees. The app's use of 3D models of human body parts also helps trainees visualize and learn complex concepts more easily. Additionally, the availability of ArMed on mobile devices makes it more accessible to a wider range of people, allowing more individuals to learn important life-saving skills.
The solution aims to tackle the issue of the lack of confidence and knowledge of first aid among people. Timely medical help and first aid can minimise risk of complications, improve chances of treatment and potentially save patientsâ€™ lives. By providing a more interactive and engaging way to learn first aid, our solution empowers people to become more confident and capable in emergency situations. Our solution has the potential to increase the number of people with formal first aid training, which can ultimately save more lives.
